    <h2><span>How are fibroids diagnosed?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>In most cases, the symptoms of fibroids are rarely felt and the patient
        does not know she has them. They are usually discovered during a vaginal examination.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ultrasound</strong>
            <p>
                If the doctor thinks fibroids may be present he/she may use an ultrasound scan to find out.
                Ultrasound can also eliminate other possible conditions which may have similar symptoms.
                Ultrasound scans are often used when the patient has heavy periods and blood tests
                have revealed nothing conclusive.
            </p>
            <p>While a bimanual examination typically can identify the presence of larger fibroids,
                gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool
                to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Trans-vaginal scan</strong>
            <p>
                A small scanner is inserted into the patient's vagina so that the uterus
                can be viewed close up.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sonography</strong>
            <p>Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture,
                which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. </p>
            <p>The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="#" onclick="show('laparoscopy/hysteroscopy');">Hysteroscopy</a></strong>
            <p> This is a small telescope that examines the inside of the uterus.
                During this procedure, if necessary, a biopsy can be taken of the
                lining of the uterus (womb).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong><a href="#" onclick="show('laparoscopy/index');">Laparoscopy</a></strong>
            <p>A laparoscope is a small device that looks at the outside of
                the uterus - where the doctor examines its size and shape.
                A laparoscope is a small flexible tube. During this procedure,
                if necessary, a biopsy can be taken of the outer layer of the uterus.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Biopsy</strong>
            <p>A small sample of the lining of the uterus is taken and then examined
                under a microscope.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>MRI</strong>
            <p>   Also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction
                of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.</p>

    <h2><span>When Should Fibroids Be Treated ?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>If fibroids are causing any symptoms, a woman should seek treatment.
        Serious symptoms requiring immediate medical attention are
        sudden or severe abdominal pain, heavy menstrual bleeding
        causing anemia (low red blood cell count), any bladder or bowel symptoms,
        recurrent miscarriages and infertility.
    </p>

    <h2><span>Treatment</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>Most fibroids do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms.
        After menopause fibroids shrink and it is unusual for fibroids to cause problems.</p>
    <p>
        Symptomatic uterine fibroids can be treated by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Medication to control symptoms</li>
        <li>Medication aimed at shrinking tumours</li>
        <li>Ultrasound fibroid destruction</li>
        <li><a href="#" onclick="show('laparoscopy/myomectomy');">Myomectomy</a>
            or radio frequency ablation</li>
        <li><a href="#" onclick="show('laparoscopy/hysteroscopy');">Hysterectomy</a></li>
        <li>Uterine artery embolization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Women who undergo evaluation at a uterine fibroid center have more options
        and most undergo uterine-preserving minimally invasive therapies.</p>
