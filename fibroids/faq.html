    <h2><span>Having fibroids means I have to have my uterus removed ?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p><strong>Fact</strong>In almost all cases, this is absolutely not true. 
        These days, an advanced surgeon from Rangnath Hospital can safely remove
        all fibroids without having to resort to
        <a href="#" onclick="show('laparoscopy/hysteroscopy');">hysterectomy </a>
        (i.e., the removal of a woman's uterus).</p>

    <h2><span>Do fibroids interfere with fertility?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p><strong>YES. Fibroids may interfere with woman's fertility.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Pregnancy Miscarriages</strong> Fibroids can distort the uterus
        so a pregnancy cannot grow properly secondary to the mass of the fibroid.
        Also, the blood supply of the pregnancy can be diverted to a growing fibroid.
        In these cases, pregnancies can miscarry.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Infertility</strong> Fibroids can grow near the fallopian tubes
        and cervix thereby blocking proper motility of sperm and egg through the uterus
        and tubes. Fibroids can also line the cavity of the uterus making
        it impossible for a pregnancy to properly implant in the uterus.</p>

    <h2><span>Can Fibroids Turn Into Cancer?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>
        Fibroids are almost always benign (not cancerous).
        Rarely (less than one in 1,000) a cancerous fibroid will occur.
    </p>
    <p> Our Doctors think that these cancers do not arise from an already-existing fibroid.
        Having fibroids does not increase the risk of developing a cancerous fibroid.
        Having fibroids also does not increase a woman's chances of getting
        other forms of cancer in the uterus.

    <h2><span>Could My Fibroids Come Back After the Treatment?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>
        Although this treatment may be successful in destroying the fibroids causing painful symptoms,
        at a later time, more fibroids may grow, become symptomatic and require additional treatment.</p>
