    <h2><span>What is the Fibroid?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>
        Fibroids are non-cancerous (benign) tumors that grow from the muscle layers of the uterus (womb).
        They are also known as uterine fibroids, myomas, or fibromyomas. </p>
    <p>Fibroids are growths of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.
        Fibroids can vary in size, from that of a bean to as large as a melon.</p>
    <p>While most fibroids are asymptomatic, they can grow and cause heavy and painful menstruation, 
        painful sexual intercourse, and urinary frequency and urgency. Some fibroids may
        interfere with pregnancy although this appears to be very rare.</p>

<div>
    <h2><span>How common are fibroids?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <ul>
        <li> Fibroids affect at least 20 of all women at sometime during their life.</li>
        <li>Women aged between 30 and 50 are the most likely to develop fibroids.
            25% women will develop benign uterine fibroid tumors by their late 40s.</li>
        <li>Overweight and obese women are at significantly higher risk of developing fibroids,
            compared to women of normal weight.</li>
        <li>Its percentage is very low for women who have age less than 20 and more than 50.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span>Signs and symptoms</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>Fibroids, particularly when small, may be entirely asymptomatic. 
        Symptoms depend on the location of the lesion and its size. </p>
    <p>Important symptoms include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abnormal gynecologic hemorrhage</li>
        <li>Heavy or painful periods</li>
        <li>Abdominal discomfort or bloating</li>
        <li>Painful defecation</li>
        <li>Back ache</li>
        <li>Urinary frequency or retention</li>
        <li>In some cases, infertility.</li>
        <li>There may also be pain during intercourse, depending on the location of the fibroid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During pregnancy they may also be the cause of miscarriage, bleeding,
        premature labor, or interference with the position of the fetus.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2><span>What are the causes of fibroids?</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>During a woman's reproductive years her estrogen and progesterone levels are high.
        When estrogen levels are high, especially during pregnancy, fibroids tend to swell.
        When estrogen levels are low fibroids may shrink, e.g. during a woman's menopause. 
    </p>
    <p>Heredity may also be a factor. Women whose mothers and/or sisters have/had fibroids 
        have a higher risk of developing them too.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2><span>Location</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="blog_text">
    <p>Growth and location are the main factors that determine if a fibroid leads
        to symptoms and problems.</p>
    <p>A small lesion can be symptomatic if located within the uterine cavity
        while a large lesion on the outside of the uterus may go unnoticed.</p>
